To run the simulation:

1, create a folder in your computer, say, Folder1

2, Download all the files including the .Rdata into Folder1
3, In Rstudio, run the code "script_singlepath_DNSMI_MC_Accuracy.R" by typing: source("./script_singlepath_DNSMI_MC_Accuracy.R")
4, After the running is completed, the outcome is stored in the matrix "montecarloout" with each column representing the result from a Monte Carlo run and each row being a measurement as indicated by theh row names.
